## Introduction
With beautiful scenes and historical monuments, Boston is one of the top tourism destinations. Here is a brief analysis of Boston Airbnb dataset from Kaggle. The code for this analysis is posted on Github repository. In this analysis, we cleaned the data and ran a linear model to predict the price.
Travelers and hosts around the world have used Airbnb to expand staying possibilities. It renders a unique and personalized way of experiencing the world and socializing with new people. You may have heard questions like "How to make your Airbnb home more attractive?" or "How to choose Airbnb home with tight budget?" The analysis could provide some insights on:
1. What are the most common words used to describe a listing?
2. How do bed and bath counts affect the price?
3. How do neighborhoods affect the prices?

## Requirements
`Jupyter notebook`
`numpy`
`pandas`
`sklearn`
`wordCloud`

## Conclusions
1. The more expensive groups like to show off their amenities and neighborhoods, while the cheaper groups like to emphasize the quality of the space.
2. Both of beds and baths have a positive effect on the price. An extra bedroom will cost 28.7 dollars more and an extra bath will cost 2.4 dollars more.
3. Premium locations are significantly more expensive. Every night in downtown is almost two nights in Roslindale.
